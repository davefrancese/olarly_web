### Teacher Registration

- [ ] Register teacher action needs endpoint
- [x] Progress bar needs some attention (pages out of sync)
- [x] When clicking on 'back' btn the field should contain input user had previously put in
- [x] Needs validation (if nothing in the input field, should not be able to progress to next page)

### Teacher Dashboard

#### Tasks

- [ ] Need endpoints to test with real data
- [ ] Should deploy of some kind due to routing (ie - when clicking on a specific task to see more, this should route to that specific tasks' route. Right now, we would have to explicitly put https... on all tasks.)

- [ ] Teachers need to be able to create a task
- [ ] Teachers need to be able to read their tasks
- [ ] Teachers need to be able to update a tasks
- [ ] Teachers need to be able to delete (complete) a task
